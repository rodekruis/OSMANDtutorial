* Scroll down the list of applications until you find Osmand and tap on it.
* Tap the [Force Stop] button

4. Drop the favorites.gpx into the root of the Osmand installation folder where Osmand stores all its maps etc. Overwriting any existing favourites.gpx file.
   E.G. Computer\[my device]\Card\Android\data\net.osmand.plus\files
